"adding a new algorithm that finds the cut point of the graph"

## Detailed Description
"A vertex in an undirected connected graph is an articulation point (or cut vertex) iff removing it (and edges through it) disconnects the graph. Articulation points represent vulnerabilities in a connected network â€“ single points whose failure would split the network into 2 or more components."
## Context
 They are useful for designing reliable networks.
