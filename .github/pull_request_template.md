#### Description of Change
1) adding the articulation point algorithm. A vertex in an undirected connected graph is an articulation point (or cut vertex) iff removing it (and edges through it) disconnects the graph.
2) changing the graph.c and graph.h files by moving the GraphRep structure to the header file.
