# Knight's Travail
<p>A knight's tour is a chessboard move sequence in which a knight visits every square precisely once. The tour is closed (or re-entrant) if the knight stops on a square that is one knight's move from the beginning square (such that it might tour the board again immediately, following the same path); otherwise, it is open.
</p>
<p>The mathematical issue of determining a knight's tour is known as the knight's tour problem. A popular challenge assigned to computer science students is to write a software to discover a knight's tour. Chessboards of other sizes than the standard 8 x 8 are used in variations of the knight's tour problem, as are irregular (non-rectangular) boards.

It moves:-
- Two squares vertically and one square horizontally
- Two squares horizontally and one square vertically

With both Forming an 'L shape'...

# Theory
The more widespread graph theory Hamiltonian route issue includes the knight's tour problem as an example. The hunt for a closed knight's tour is another example of a Hamiltonian cycle issue. The knight's tour issue, in contrast to the generic Hamiltonian route problem, may be resolved in linear time.

Knight's graph showing all possible paths for a knight's tour on a standard 8 Ã— 8 chessboard. The numbers on each node indicate the number of possible moves that can be made from that position.
The knight's tour problem is an instance of the more general Hamiltonian path problem in graph theory. The problem of finding a closed knight's tour is similarly an instance of the Hamiltonian cycle problem. Unlike the general Hamiltonian path problem, the knight's tour problem can be solved in linear time.
