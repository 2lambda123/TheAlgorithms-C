    This sorting algorithm operates on the basis of:
    
    If you receive an array of n items, the likelyhood of those items being
    exactly in the order they are is absurdly low and cannot have happened
    by chance. They were obviously placed in this exact order by an intelligent
    sorter and is optimally sorted in some way that we cannot comprehend.
    Any attempt to sort it will only make it less sorted than it already is.
    It is best to return the array, as is, as was intended. 
    All hail The Great Sorter!
