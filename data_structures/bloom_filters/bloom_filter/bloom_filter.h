 * [bloom filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter)
 * @details A Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure,
 * that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set. False positive
 * matches are possible, but false negatives are not â€“ in other words, a query
 * returns either "possibly in set" or "definitely not in set". Elements can be
 * added to the set, but not removed (description of bloom filter from
 * wikipedia)
